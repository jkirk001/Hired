# Looking to hire?

# This is my current project/skill list. Below is a list of technologies used and why I used them.

#React -- It gave me the flexibility to make a single page app with dynamic elements that change in response to changes to global state (light mode/dark Mode ) and local state ( flip cards ).  
  #Context -- Rather than use redux for a site this small,  context allowed a simple and lightweight solution to managing global state.  
  #React-Spring -- Rather than using React-Transition-Group (which is wonderful) react spring gave me the tools and hooks needed out of the box to give my flip cards the spring they needed. React-spring is a super powerful, yet fairly simple tool.  
  #Functional components -- Lighter weight, less code, and arguably more versatile than class components.  
  
#Fireabase -- Super quick set-up, great support, free hosting. While I love usiing mongo and express to serve APIs and persist user data, Firebase is to perfect for quick back-end work.
